## Overview
This program uses a machine learning model to predict the flood risk for a given UK postcode. The model is trained on historical data and is used to predict the flood risk from an unlabelled dataset.
This is my playground project where I explore different machine learning models, prediction methods and data transformation techniques.
Feel free to use the code as you see fit.

## Flood Risk Calculation
Flood risk is calculated from the median house price in the postcode and the flood risk.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Zvapo/uk-flood-risk-detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash
cd uk-flood-risk-detection
```
3. Create a virtual environment:
``` bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
``` bash
conda activate uk-flood-risk-detection
```

## Usage
1. Train the model, fine-tune the hyperparameters and create a postcode databse file by running:
``` bash
python main.py
```

2. The folder should now contain a file called `postcodedb.csv` which contains the postcode database as well as the models trained on the postcode labelled file.

3. Use the tool to predict the flood risk for a given UK postcode by running:
``` bash
python main.py predict-risk <postcode>
```

4. The tool will return the flood risk for the postcode given the model was trained on the postcode.

## Examples
1. Predict the flood risk for a given postcode:
``` bash
python main.py predict-risk "PO7 8PR" "SO17 1NS" # add quotes if the postcode contains a space
```

2. Add more data to the model and train it again:
``` bash
python main.py add-file file <path_to_data_file> method-risk <method_name> method-house-price <method_name>
```

3. List the available models:
``` bash
python main.py list-methods
```

4. For more information on the commands, use the help flag:
``` bash
python main.py -h
```
